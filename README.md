# Quotes-Machine Project for the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Framework Libraries Curriculum

This project is my first attempt to create a React app and connect it to an API for a quotes database.

The app design was inspired by the official React Tic Tac Toe example, so I forgot to use class components from the Curriculum.

I connected to a celebrities' quotes database through an API using the fetch method.

Couldn't find an affordable way to share a quote on Facebook; I could only send the link and static open graph info.

The use of the Font Awesome library may seem excessive for just one left-quote symbol, but it mainly serves as my practice.

And also used with not much understanding CSSTransition hook to animate quote appearance.
